I am currently a senior research scientist at [MBZUAI-IFM](https://ifm.mbzuai.ac.ae/) working on foundation models and reasoning models. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) specializing in LLM-related research, and co-founder and CTO of [LibrAI](https://www.librai.tech/) Technologies. 

What's New (updated on 2025-09-06)
======
* Aug 2025 --- We released [AgentFly](https://github.com/Agent-One-Lab/AgentFly), an agent training framework. The project is led by PhD student Renxi Wang, and the team will continue improving it. We'd be happy to hear from anyone interested in collaborating or providing feedback.
* June 2025 --- I joined [MBZUAI-IFM](https://ifm.mbzuai.ac.ae/), working on foundation models with a focus on reasoning model development.
* Feb 2025 --- We discovered that LLMs don't work well when there are conflicting instructions. See our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15851) for more details.
* Feb 2025 --- Our work [SCALAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13753) is out! It's an uncheatable long-context LLM evaluation framework - welcome to use it!
* Jan 2025 --- We organized a tutorial on [Safety Issues for Generative AI](https://coling2025.org/program/tutorials/#tutorial-7-safety-issues-for-generative-ai) at COLING. 
* Jan 2025 --- We release [Libra-Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.librai.tech/), a leaderboard for LLM evaluation.
