I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/).

I am cofounder and CTO of [LibrAI](https://www.librai.tech/).

Previously, I did my PhD at The University of Melbourne, fortunately supervised by [Prof. Timothy Baldwin](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tbaldwin/) and [Associate Prof. Martin Tomko](https://www.tomko.org/), and [Dr. Maria Vasardani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-vasardani-6b9a2b5/?originalSubdomain=au).
