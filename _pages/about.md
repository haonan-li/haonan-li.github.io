I am currently a senior research scientist at [MBZUAI-IFM](https://ifm.mbzuai.ac.ae/) working on foundation models and reasoning models. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) specializing in LLM-related research, and co-founder and CTO of [LibrAI](https://www.librai.tech/) Technologies. 

What's New (updated on 2025-09-06)
======
* Aug 2025 --- We released [AgentFly](https://github.com/Agent-One-Lab/AgentFly), an agent training framework. The project is led by PhD student Renxi Wang, and the team will continue improving it. We'd be happy to hear from anyone interested in collaborating or providing feedback.
* June 2025 --- I joined [MBZUAI-IFM](https://ifm.mbzuai.ac.ae/), working on foundation models with a focus on reasoning model development.
* Feb 2025 --- We discovered that LLMs don't work well when there are conflicting instructions. See our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15851) for more details.
* Feb 2025 --- Our work [SCALAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13753) is out! It's an uncheatable long-context LLM evaluation framework - welcome to use it!
* Jan 2025 --- We organized a tutorial on [Safety Issues for Generative AI](https://coling2025.org/program/tutorials/#tutorial-7-safety-issues-for-generative-ai) at COLING. 
* Jan 2025 --- We release [Libra-Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.librai.tech/), a leaderboard for LLM evaluation. [Website](https://leaderboard.librai.tech/), [X](https://x.com/haonanlp/status/1875194364399599881), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7280225099218141184/).
<!-- * Dec 2024 --- Our Survey paper on AI safety was accepted by [JAIR](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair). Title: Against The Achilles' Heel: A Survey on Red Teaming for Generative Models. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00629).
* Nov 2024 --- We release [Nanda LLM](https://huggingface.co/MBZUAI/Llama-3-Nanda-10B-Chat) a 10B Hindi-English bilingual hashtag#LLM adapted on top of Llama3-8B.  [Paper](https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/Llama-3-Nanda-10B-Chat/blob/main/Llama-3-Nanda-10B-Chat-Paper.pdf) [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/monojit-choudhury-54225898_nanda-llm-activity-7257400193447256064-HJ33/)
* Oct 2024 --- We (LibrAI) are participating as exhibitors at [GITEX](https://www.gitex.com/), Dubai.
* July 2024 --- We (LibrAI) are participating as exhibitors at [WAIC - World Artificial Intelligence Conference](https://www.linkedin.com/company/worldaiconf/). 
* May 2024 --- I have five co-authored papers accepted by [ACL 2024](https://2024.aclweb.org/), see you in Bangkok, Thailand!
* Apr 2024 --- We did a comprehensive survey on generative AI attack and defense (red-teaming). We target a better and safer AI development. [[Github](https://github.com/Libr-AI/OpenRedTeaming)][[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00629)]
* Apr 2024 --- Our work [Do-Not-Answer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13387.pdf) is featured in the latest [Stanford AI Index Report 2024](https://aiindex.stanford.edu/report/).
* Feb 2024 --- We release [Loki](https://github.com/Libr-AI/OpenFactVerification): An Open-source Tool for Fact Verification. We also release a commercial version with fancy UI and better user experience. [TRY IT NOW!](https://aip.librai.tech/app/fact-check/new)
* Dec 2023 --- We release [LLM360](https://www.llm360.ai/), A framework for open-source LLMs to foster transparency, trust, and collaborative research.

* Aug 2023 --- We release [Jais and Jais-chat](https://huggingface.co/papers/2308.16149): Arabic-centric foundation and instruction-tuned open generative large language models. Link to [Technique Report](https://www.inceptioniai.org/jais/docs/Technicalpaper.pdf), [Blog](https://www.cerebras.net/blog/jais-a-new-pinnacle-in-open-arabic-nlp).
* June 2023 --- We release [CMMLU](https://github.com/haonan-li/CMMLU), a massive multitask language understanding benchmark in Chinese.
