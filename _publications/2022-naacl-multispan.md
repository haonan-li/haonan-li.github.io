## Abstract
Most existing reading comprehension datasets focus on single-span answers, which can be extracted as a single contiguous span from a given text passage.
Multi-span questions, i.e., questions whose answer is a series of multiple discontiguous spans in the text, are common in real life but are less studied.
In this paper, we present MultiSpanQA, a new dataset that focuses on questions with multi-span answers.
Raw questions and contexts are extracted from the Natural Questions dataset.
After multi-span re-annotation, MultiSpanQA consists of over a total of 6,000 multi-span questions in the basic version, and over 19,000 examples with unanswerable questions, and questions with single-, and multi-span answers in the expanded version.
We introduce new metrics for the purposes of multi-span question answering evaluation, and establish several baselines using advanced models.
Finally, we propose a new model which beats all baselines and achieves the state-of-the-art on our dataset.
